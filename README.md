# **Crop and Weed Detection System**

## **Project Title and Description**
The **Crop and Weed Detection System** is an AI-powered solution designed to identify and classify crops and weeds from images. This system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images as either "Crop" or "Weed" and annotate field images with bounding boxes for better visualization. The project aims to assist in precision agriculture by streamlining weed detection and enhancing crop management.

## **Features and Functionalities**
- **Image Classification**:  
  Classify individual images as either "Crop" or "Weed."
- **Field Image Annotation**:  
  Automatically annotate field images with bounding boxes, identifying crop and weed regions.
- **Interactive User Interface**:  
  A user-friendly frontend for uploading images and viewing results.
- **Visualization**:  
  Real-time display of annotated images with bounding boxes.
- **Analytics Dashboard**:  
  Provides statistical insights such as crop-to-weed ratio.
- **Extendable for Robotics**:  
  The system is designed to integrate with robotic weed removal systems.
